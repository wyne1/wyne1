## Hi there! 👋 I'm Zeerak Nadeem, a passionate AI Engineer at RED MARBLE AI.

🚀 With over 6 years of experience in AI and Machine Learning, I've specialized in delivering and integrating tailored Generative AI solutions into client workflows using MLOps best practices. My work enhances business processes and customer interactions across diverse industries.

👨‍💻 **Recent Highlights:**
- **Tender Response Generation:** Automated bidding using GPT-4 and text embeddings to repurpose similar past bids for new projects, reducing response time and boosting revenue.
- **Contract Analysis Tool:** Led the development of a contract analysis tool with Google Gemini to assess compliance against benchmark questions, enhancing review efficiency and accuracy.
- **Multi-Agent Workflows:** Developed graph-based agentic workflows using LangGraph, enabling multi-agent orchestration and robust solution design.

🛠️ **My Tech Toolkit Includes:**
- **Generative AI:** LangChain, LangGraph, HuggingFace, LLMs, Transformers, RAG, Prompt Engineering, Multi-Agent Workflows, Vector Databases.
- **Machine Learning & AI:** Computer Vision, NLP, Forecasting, Clustering, NLTK, OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- **MLOps & Cloud Platforms:** AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, MLFlow, Airflow, SageMaker, Databricks, FastAPI.
- **Databases:** SQL, NoSQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Elasticsearch.

🧠 I thrive in Agile environments, leading teams to fine-tune models, strategize roadmaps, and align technological solutions with business goals. My ability to communicate complex AI/ML concepts to stakeholders bridges the gap between technology and business.

Let's connect and build innovative AI solutions together! 🌟
